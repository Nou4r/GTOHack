Cheat/mod menu for the game GTFO
Compile, drop the files in the GTFO_DATA/MANAGED folder and inject using any mono injector as follows:

Namespace: gtfohack
class name: Loader
Method name: Load

I recommend this injector:

"smi.exe inject -p GTFO -a gtfohack.dll -n gtfohack -c Loader -m Load"

The menu does not contain any copywrited material from the game. It was written by me and from help of gaming forums
such as uknowncheats, and guidedhacking.
This is the first time i've messed with unity engine, It was fun.
All the functions work online as host. about 70% work as non-host. 
Don't be a jerk and mess up other people's game by using this when it's unwanted.
Have fun.
